      Going into this first term, my experience with creating websites was from pre-created wire frame layouts where you just having to add your own content to, and the occasional miss click of f12 on the keyboard. Now coming to the end of this assignment I feel as though I have learnt a great deal about websites in far greater detail than I had imagined. However, I feel as though I have far more to learn to be able to do this kind of work as a full-time job, despite being undecided on a career path thus far. To begin with I aimed for something that would use the skills I have learned in seminars to create this website. However, after restarting this project several times with different approaches, and considering example sites on code pen, and other sites I regularly use as inspiration.<br>
      As the weeks went by I felt that some weeks I was making progress by adapting the materials covered into my initial assignment copy. However, other weeks I felt a little overwhelmed and restarted to make sure that I could remember the previous materials as well as trying to gain a better understanding of the content I felt I didnâ€™t understand. While beginning the assignment again, I also changed the software I was using from code pen to thimble as I found it easier to use. <br>
      In general, I feel as though I have learned a lot from creating my own site, more than I believe that I could have from only using the materials in the seminars. Overall, I feel as though I still have a lot to learn in order to create a better product in the future, but this assignment has given me a good outline of how to begin a project like this.
