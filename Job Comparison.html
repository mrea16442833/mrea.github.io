      Comparing these jobs from the position of someone living in Northampton, the furthest to travel without changing living locations would be Plymouth at over 4 hours each way to travel. Without moving, this job would be nearly impossible to maintain due to this fact alone. The other two have far more reasonable travel times, despite their distance, that is possible to commute to daily far more than the Plymouth based job.
      <br><br>
      As the junior JavaScript Web Developer job is a junior position, the pay is therefore lower than that of a non-junior. In terms of pay, the Net Web developer job has the greatest salary potential, per annum. In salary alone, this makes it the best job based on salary alone.
      <br><br>
      In terms of required skills, the junior position job would be the most forgiving, due to the fact that it is a junior position, and learning on the job is a likely possibility. Therefor the job with the least technical requirements is the junior job. The Net Web Developer job requires the most diverse skill set, which is reflected in the amount offered per annum, making it potentially the most difficult, but most financially rewarding of the three.
