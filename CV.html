      <p>Hi, I’m Matthew Rea, 20 years old and a computing student at Northampton University. Currently I am studying; web development, computer communications, problem solving and programming and software engineering. Currently I’m not sure as to what I want to do when I finish university. I’m still getting the hang of Java script but am enjoying learning about it and am eager to learn more. I have some work experience in multiple fields of employment, ranging from pub and café work to lifeguarding. </p>

      <p>Deciding on a university course wasn’t an easy task for me. At the time of finishing my A-levels I was unsure of what I wanted to study so I took a gap year. During that year I looked across multiple Universities at many different courses. After a while I decided I wanted to study computing but wasn’t sure which university to study at. I eventually decided on Northampton due to their enthusiasm, variety and extensiveness of the knowledge of their lecturers.</p>
